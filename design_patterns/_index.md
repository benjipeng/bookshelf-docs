# An overview of Design Patterns in OOP

> Design patterns are **typical** solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design problem in your code. They are descriptions or templates for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

Design patterns are categorized into three types:

- `Creational Patterns:` Try to *create* objects in a manner suitable to the situation. _{deal with object creation mechanism}_
- `Structural Patterns:` Compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to gain new functionality. _{class / object composition}_
- `Behavioral Patterns:` Algorithm and assignment of responsibilities between objects.
